Scenario 1: Test to check if the resource handler is added correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testAddResourceHandlers
  Description: This test will check if the resource handler is added correctly with the correct path and if the resource location is set up correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and the properties object to return a specific upload directory.
    Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
    Assert: Verify that the addResourceHandler, addResourceLocations, setCachePeriod, resourceChain and addResolver methods were called on the registry with the correct parameters.
  Validation: 
    This test case will verify if the resource handler is being added correctly with the provided path and resource location. This is important to ensure that resources are served correctly from the specified upload directory.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the cache period is set correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testCachePeriodSetting
  Description: This test will check if the cache period for the resources is set correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and the properties object to return a specific upload directory.
    Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
    Assert: Verify that the setCachePeriod method was called on the registry with the correct parameter (3600).
  Validation: 
    This test case will verify if the cache period for the resources is set correctly. This is important for performance reasons as it reduces the load on the server.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the resource chain is set correctly

Details: 
  TestName: testResourceChainSetting
  Description: This test will check if the resource chain is set correctly for the resources.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and the properties object to return a specific upload directory.
    Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
    Assert: Verify that the resourceChain method was called on the registry with the correct parameter (true).
  Validation: 
    This test case will verify if the resource chain is set correctly. This is important to ensure that the resources are served in the correct order.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the resource resolver is added correctly

Details: 
  TestName: testResourceResolverAddition
  Description: This test will check if the resource resolver is added correctly to the resource chain.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and the properties object to return a specific upload directory.
    Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
    Assert: Verify that the addResolver method was called on the registry with an instance of PathResourceResolver.
  Validation: 
    This test case will verify if the resource resolver is added correctly. This is important to ensure that the resources are resolved correctly when requested.
