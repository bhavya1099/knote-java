"""
Scenario 1: Check if method returns correct upload directory
Details:
  TestName: testMethodReturnsCorrectUploadDir.
  Description: This test checks if the getUploadDir() method is returning the correct upload directory as set in the application's configuration properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an expected value for the uploadDir in the application's configuration properties.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected output.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getUploadDir() method is correctly retrieving the value of the uploadDir property. The correct operation of this method is important for the system to know where to store uploaded files.
Scenario 2: Test if method returns null when the upload directory is not set
Details:
  TestName: testMethodReturnsNullIfUploadDirNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check if getUploadDir() method returns null when the upload directory is not set in the application's configuration properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Leave the uploadDir in the application's configuration properties unset.
  Act: Call getUploadDir() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null, indicating that the uploadDir property has not been set.
Validation:
  This test is meant to verify the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when the uploadDir property is not set. It illustrates that the method is robust to misconfigurations and doesn't cause errors when upload dir is not specified.
Scenario 3: Test if method returns different values when upload directory changes
Details:
  TestName: testMethodReturnsDifferentValuesForDifferentUploadDirs.
  Description: This test checks whether the getUploadDir() method correctly reflects changes to the uploadDir value in the application's configuration properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an initial value for the uploadDir, then change it to a different value during the test.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method after each change.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected output after each change.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getUploadDir() method is correctly linked to the uploadDir configuration property and updates its return value accordingly. This ensures that if the upload directory is changed during system operation, the application will correctly update to use the new directory.
