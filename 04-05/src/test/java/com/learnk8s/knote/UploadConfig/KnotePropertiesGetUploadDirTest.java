"""
Scenario 1: Test to check the default value of uploadDir
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultUploadDirValue
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getUploadDir method returns the default value of uploadDir, which is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are just checking the default value.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns the default value of the uploadDir field. This test is significant as it ensures that the method behaves correctly if the uploadDir has not been explicitly set.
Scenario 2: Test to check the uploadDir after it has been set
Details:
  TestName: testUploadDirAfterSettingValue
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getUploadDir method returns the correct value after the uploadDir has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the uploadDir to a known value using a setter method or constructor.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns the value of the uploadDir field after it has been set. This test is significant as it ensures that the method behaves correctly and returns the correct value after the uploadDir has been set.
Scenario 3: Test to check the uploadDir when it is set to an empty string
Details:
  TestName: testUploadDirWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getUploadDir method returns an empty string when the uploadDir is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the uploadDir to an empty string using a setter method or constructor.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns an empty string when the uploadDir is set to an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior when the uploadDir is set to an empty string.
