"""
Scenario 1: Regular Scenario
Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDir
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUploadDir method returns the correct upload directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: The uploadDir is set to a known value.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known uploadDir.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns the upload directory. The expected result is the same as the known value set for uploadDir. This test is significant as it ensures the functionality of the getUploadDir method.
Scenario 2: Null Scenario
Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the uploadDir is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: The uploadDir is set to null.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns null when the uploadDir is null. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it ensures the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the upload directory is not set.
Scenario 3: Empty String Scenario
Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the uploadDir is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: The uploadDir is set to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir method correctly returns an empty string when the uploadDir is an empty string. The expected result is an empty string. This test is significant as it ensures the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the upload directory is an empty string.
