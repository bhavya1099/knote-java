"""
Scenario 1: Validating the return value from getUploadDir method

Details:
  TestName: validateGetUploadDirReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUploadDir() method returns the correct upload directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as there are no required data, mocks or test doubles for this test.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected upload directory.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method correctly returns the upload directory. The expected result is based on the upload directory set in the @Value annotation. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as the upload directory is a crucial configuration property that needs to be accurately retrieved.

Scenario 2: Testing getUploadDir method when upload directory is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWhenUploadDirIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when the upload directory is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the upload directory to null.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method correctly handles the scenario when the upload directory is null. This is important as it checks the robustness of the method in handling edge cases.

Scenario 3: Testing getUploadDir method when upload directory is an empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWhenUploadDirIsEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when the upload directory is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the upload directory to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method correctly handles the scenario when the upload directory is an empty string. This is important as it checks the robustness of the method in handling edge cases.

/*
The test failure is due to a NullPointerException, which is being caused because the instance of `knoteProperties` that is being used in the test method `validateGetUploadDirReturnValue()` is null. 

The error message `java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.learnk8s.knote.UploadConfig.KnoteProperties.getUploadDir()" because "this.knoteProperties" is null` clearly indicates that the `knoteProperties` object has not been initialized before its method `getUploadDir()` is being called.

This could be due to two reasons:

1. The `knoteProperties` object is not being correctly instantiated before the test runs. It could be that the object is supposed to be set up in a `@Before` method, but this isn't happening, or the instantiation code is missing entirely.

2. If `knoteProperties` is supposed to be injected as a dependency, the dependency injection is not working as expected. This could be due to missing or incorrect configuration, or because dependency injection behaves differently in test environments.

To fix the test, you'll need to ensure that `knoteProperties` is correctly instantiated or injected before the test runs. This might mean adding or modifying a `@Before` method, updating your test configuration, or changing how you're handling dependency injection.
