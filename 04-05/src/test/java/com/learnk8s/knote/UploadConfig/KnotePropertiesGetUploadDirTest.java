"""
Scenario 1: Validating the return value from getUploadDir method

Details:
  TestName: validateGetUploadDirReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUploadDir() method returns the correct upload directory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class, and set the uploadDir property.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value against the expected upload directory.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method correctly returns the upload directory. The expected result is based on the upload directory set in the Arrange step. This test is significant to ensure that the upload directory is correctly retrieved, which is crucial for file upload operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Testing getUploadDir method when uploadDir is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWithNullUploadDir
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when uploadDir is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class without setting the uploadDir property.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method returns null when the uploadDir is not set. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle null values, and the application can appropriately handle scenarios where the upload directory is not set.

Scenario 3: Testing getUploadDir method with empty uploadDir

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWithEmptyUploadDir
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when uploadDir is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class and set the uploadDir property as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method returns an empty string when the uploadDir is set as such. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle empty values, and the application can appropriately handle scenarios where the upload directory is set but empty.
