"""
Scenario 1: Validating the return value from getUploadDir method

Details:
  TestName: validateGetUploadDirReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUploadDir() method returns the correct upload directory.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class, and set the uploadDir property.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value against the expected upload directory.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method is correctly retrieving the upload directory. The expected result is based on the upload directory set in the Arrange phase. This test is significant to ensure that the upload directory is correctly retrieved, which is crucial for file upload operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Testing getUploadDir method when uploadDir is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWithNullUploadDir
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when uploadDir is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class without setting the uploadDir property.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method returns null when uploadDir is not set. The expected result is null since no upload directory was set in the Arrange phase. This test is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected when no upload directory is set.

Scenario 3: Testing getUploadDir method with empty uploadDir

Details:
  TestName: testGetUploadDirWithEmptyUploadDir
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getUploadDir() method when uploadDir is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the KnoteProperties class and set the uploadDir property as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getUploadDir() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getUploadDir() method returns an empty string when uploadDir is set as an empty string. The expected result is an empty string since that's what was set in the Arrange phase. This test is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected when the upload directory is an empty string.

The reason for the test failure is that the `getUploadDir()` method is returning a null value, which is not expected in the test case. The test case expects a non-null value and thus, the `assertNotNull(actualUploadDir);` assertion fails, causing the test to fail.

In the business logic, the `uploadDir` field is initialized as null and no value is set to it before the `getUploadDir()` method is called. Therefore, the method returns null. 

To resolve this issue, a value should be assigned to `uploadDir` before the `getUploadDir()` method is called in the test case. If the method is expected to handle null values, this should be reflected in the test case as well.

    KnoteProperties knoteProperties = new KnoteProperties();
    // Act

    // Assert
    assertNotNull(actualUploadDir);

/*
The test case `testGetUploadDirWithEmptyUploadDir` is failing because it is trying to assert that the `uploadDir` variable, which is null, is not null.

In the test case, we create a new instance of `KnoteProperties` class and then immediately call the `getUploadDir()` method. The `uploadDir` field in the `KnoteProperties` instance is not set to any value before the `getUploadDir()` method is called, so it returns `null`. The test case then asserts that the returned value is not `null` which leads to the failure.

The `uploadDir` field needs to be initialized before calling the `getUploadDir()` method to make the test pass. If the test case is intended to handle the scenario where `uploadDir` is `null`, then the assertion should check that the returned value is `null`, not that it isn't.

    // Arrange
    KnoteProperties knoteProperties = new KnoteProperties();
    // Act
    String actualUploadDir = knoteProperties.getUploadDir();
    // Assert
    assertNotNull(actualUploadDir);
