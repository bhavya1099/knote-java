ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getUploadDir_caabfc00fd
Scenario 1: Test to check successful getUploadDir method
Details:
  TestName: validateNormalGetUploadDir.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUploadDir method correctly retrieves the value of the upload directory, especially under normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the object of the class and set the uploadDir variable with a valid string.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use assertEqual to check if the returned value is correct with respect to the value set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the method returns the correct value of uploadDir when it's invoked. This is essential to validate that the file storage directory is correctly set and retrieved in the system.
Scenario 2: Test to check getUploadDir method when uploadDir is null
Details:
  TestName: validateGetUploadDirWhenNull
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getUploadDir method works correctly when the uploadDir is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the object of the class and don't set any value to uploadDir variable.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks if the method correctly handles the scenario when the uploadDir value doesn't exist (null). This is a vital aspect of error handling, ensuring that the system functions rightly even when files storage directory has not been set.
Scenario 3: Test to check getUploadDir method with empty value.
Details:
  TestName: validateGetUploadDirWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the getUploadDir method when the upload directory string is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the object of the class and set the uploadDir variable with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke getUploadDir method.
  Assert: Use assertEqual to check if the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method correctly returns the empty string set for the uploadDir. It verifies that the method behaves as expected when an empty directory path is set which is a crucial aspect under test, examining the procedures when no file storage directory is set or it's unintentionally left as an empty string.
