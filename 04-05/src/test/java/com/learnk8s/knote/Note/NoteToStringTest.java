Scenario 1: Note with Non-Empty Description

Details:
  TestName: noteWithNonEmptyDescription
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the toString method when the Note object has a non-empty description. The purpose is to verify that the description is accurately returned as the string representation of the Note object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Note instance with a non-empty description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the toString method matches the description that was set during the creation of the Note instance.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method returns the exact description assigned to the Note. This test is significant because it confirms the direct and typical use-case functionality of the toString method, ensuring that basic object representation via strings is correct.

Scenario 2: Note with Empty Description

Details:
  TestName: noteWithEmptyDescription
  Description: This test examines how the toString method handles a Note object with an empty string as its description. This scenario is important to test as it represents the boundary condition where the description contains the minimum possible length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Note instance with an empty description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the toString method is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the toString method returns an empty string when the Note's description is set as such. This test is crucial for verifying that the toString method correctly handles and represents empty descriptions, which may be a common scenario in practical applications.

Scenario 3: Note with Null Description

Details:
  TestName: noteWithNullDescription
  Description: Evaluates the functionality of the toString method when the Note object's description is null. This test is critical as it checks the method's robustness in handling null values without causing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Note instance with a null description.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the toString method is null.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString method can gracefully handle null descriptions by returning a null value. This test is essential to ensure the method's robustness and to avoid runtime exceptions in scenarios where descriptions might not be set, safeguarding against potential application crashes.

By testing these scenarios, we can ensure that the toString method of the Note entity behaves correctly in typical usage, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios, providing a reliable and predictable method for obtaining the string representation of Note objects.
